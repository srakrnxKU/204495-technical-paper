  abstract = {This book covers the field of machine learning, which is the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. This exciting addition to the McGraw-Hill Series in Computer Science focuses on the concepts and techniques that contribute to the rapidly changing field of machine learning---including probability and statistics, artificial intelligence, and neural networks---unifying them all in a logical and coherent manner.},
